# About me
Hello, my name is Eryk, and I am a second year BSc Computer Science & Cybersecurity student, as well as an aspiring cybersecurity professional who is proactively developing strong networking fundamentals. I aim to do so by achieving my Cisco CCST and Google Cybersecurity qualifications. 

I am committed to prevent threat actors from compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by honing my proficiency in Linux and security tools such as Wireshark & Suricata. I am detail-oriented and keen on honing technical skills valued in blue teams by building and maintaining my home lab with Splunk and a Linux VM.
